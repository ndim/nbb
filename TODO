========================================================================
Release Plans:
========================================================================

nbb-0.1
 * Start new git repo (get rid of ndim-git-utils history).
 * Clean up git tags.

nbb-0.5
 * Write docs: man page equivalent, README, NEWS, HACKING.

nbb-1.0
 * Make public release.

========================================================================
TODO (some time):
========================================================================

 * Separate generic plugin/command/etc. stuff and nbb specific
   code into separate modules.
 * Switch plugins.Foo.validate() functions to different protocol:
   Either return or raise an exception.
 * Use different exceptions for plugins signalling detection failure
   to detect() and detect() to signal "no matching plugin detected"
   to detect()'s caller.
 * BS support: cmake, scons, ...
 * VCS support: SVN, darcs, hg, ...
 * Out-of-source builds for systems which require in-source-tree builds:
   "cp -rl foo.src foo.build"?
 * General removal of redundancy in Python code.
 * Useful logging infrastructure, and --debug etc user interface.
 * Make sure the "if cmp ... mv .. rm" in make rules are correct and useful.
 * More declarative syntax elements in the Python code.
 * Use declarations for command line parsing, and help text generation.
   Use optparse stuff for both global params and extra optparse stuff
   for each command?
 * Add global --nick or similar option to determine the branch
   name to use for composing the pathes.
 * Store config in ${srcdir}/.nbb.conf instead of 'git config'?
   More portable. bzr does not have a config interface, for example.
 * Model different "stages" of e.g. automake builds as distinct objects,
   including proper dependency detectors, and stuff? OK, we're not going
   to duplicate scons here.
 * Bash syntax completion
 * Man page or something similar. Generate from help texts?
 * Command aliases:
     make -> build    (for automake, or similar mapping)
 * Make automake's make depend on configure etc.
 * Test sh command like run command.

========================================================================
DONE:
========================================================================

 * Implement sh and run commands.
 * supports execution of user commands in source, build, install dirs
 * Do not move command objects to plugin detection framework (bad idea!)
 * Find or implement @abstractmethod decorator.
 * Unify detect() methods.
 * Design nice user interface. Requirements:
   * print top_srcdir, builddir, installdir. OK: 'config'
   * run 'autoreconf' type step. OK: 'init'
   * run 'configure' type step. OK: 'configure'
   * run 'make' type step. OK: 'build'
   * run 'make install' type step. OK: 'install'
   * run custom (make) commands. OK: 'make'
 * VCS config support ('git config', bzr does not support anything like that)
 * BS autodetection might discover more than one BS instance of the same type?
 * Test cases for proper handling of detecting (0, 1, >1) x (VCS, BS).
 * Build system support: automake/autoconf
 * Merge stuff from Eclipse to src/own/nbb and vice versa.
 * Write test cases for init, configure, build, install.
 * Write test cases for all nbb commands.
 * Determine required feature sets (properties, new-style classes, etc.)
   and then check that the Python environment is actually compatible.
   @classmethod -> Python 2.4
   new style classes -> Python 2.2
 * Add pydoc docs.
 * Fine-tune init, configure, build, install commands with knowledge
   gained with git-amb, especially the command interdependencies.
   (Nothing to do! :)
